### Objective:

The objective of the project is to develop a user-friendly, open-source web application for online voting. \ The application will support customizable voting methods and provide a transparent and accessible voting process. \ It will focus on ease of use, flexibility, and efficient vote management for administrators.

### Planned result of the individual topics:

  1. A real-time dashboard for administrators that displays voting progress (e.g., how many members have voted) and live results as votes are cast. 
  1. Dynamic data visualization tools, such as charts and graphs, to provide a clear and up-to-date overview of voting trends.
  1. The ability to export voting data in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for further analysis or archiving purposes.
  1. A fully responsive design that ensures the voting application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, adapting to different screen sizes and ensuring usability across various platforms (phones, tablets, laptops).
  1. A secure administrative backend where party officials can create, edit, and manage voting events, including setting deadlines, voter eligibility and choose from different voting methods.
  1. Archival functionality that securely stores completed voting, with read-only access to ensure the results cannot be tampered with after the voting period ends.
